Lesson 2: These are the changes to create the game loop 

step 1: add a pygame clock to control the frame rate
clock = pygame.time.Clock() # put just before the game loop starts

step 2: add a while loop to keep the game running
game_over = False
while not game_over:
    ...
    clock.tick(5) # Limit the frame rate to 5 frames per second (FPS)

step 3: add an event loop to handle user input and quit the game
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            game_over = True
    

step 4: print each event to see what events are being generated
We'll see that the games is "listening" to and identifying our keyboard presses and mouse movements.

step 5: add a few more colour constants
COLOUR_BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
COLOUR_RED = (255, 0, 0)  
COLOUR_YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
COLOUR_ORANGE = (255, 165, 0)

step 6: listen for the keydown event, check the key pressed and change the colour of the snake based on these rules:
    B -> blue
    R -> red
    Y -> yellow
    G -> green
    O -> orange
